# Project Evolution

An RPG game built through Test-Driven Development (TDD), evolving from the simplest possible game to Ultima IV-level gameplay.

## Philosophy

This project follows a strict TDD evolution approach:
1. Write a failing test
2. Make it pass with the simplest implementation
3. Add a new feature through a new test
4. Repeat

## Current State - Generation 0

The simplest possible game:
- You start the game
- You win

## Running the Game

```bash
dotnet run --project ProjectEvolution.Game
```

## Running Tests

```bash
dotnet test
```

## Tech Stack

- C# / .NET 9.0
- xUnit for testing
- Console-based interface

## Evolution Goal

To reach Ultima IV level of:
- Gameplay depth (virtues, quests, exploration)
- Graphics (ASCII art evolving to tile-based)
- Engagement (story, character development, combat)

## Current Features

- [x] Game starts
- [x] Game is immediately won

## Next Evolution

TBD - What feature should we add next?
