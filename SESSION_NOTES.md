- **Integrated mob encounters**: Walking into 'M' triggers combat!
- Defeated mobs removed from map (permanent progress!)
- Random encounters drastically reduced (5-15% vs old 20-40%)
- Random encounters are now "ambushes" from hidden enemies
- Mobs are the PRIMARY encounter system now!
- FIXED: Treasure test ranges (depth bonus was miscalculated)
- **Test Count**: 124 passing ✅

#### Generation 31: AI, Fog of War & Dungeon Maps (CURRENT) 🗺️
- **Mob AI System**: Mobs hunt the player!
  - Detection range: 5 tiles (Manhattan distance)
  - Mobs move toward player each turn
  - Simple pathfinding (try horizontal, then vertical)
  - Mobs outside range stay dormant
- **Fog of War**: Exploration-based visibility
  - Only explored tiles shown on map ('?' for unexplored)
  - Player vision range: 3 tiles
  - Explored tiles stay revealed permanently
  - Strategic reconnaissance required!
- **Real Dungeon Maps**: Procedurally generated interiors
  - 30x30 dungeon grid with rooms & corridors
  - 5-8 rooms per dungeon level
  - Rooms connected by L-shaped corridors
  - Wall collision detection
  - Can't move through walls
  - Larger viewport (7 tiles) in dungeons
  - Persistent dungeon layouts per level
- **UI Overhaul for Dungeons**:
  - Dual rendering: world map vs dungeon map
  - Dungeon uses compact ASCII (@ . █)
  - World map shows fog of war
  - Updated legends for each mode
- **Test Count**: 134 passing ✅ (+10 new tests!)

#### Generation 32: Game of Life Population Control (CURRENT) ⚖️
- **BALANCE PATCH**: Mobs were too aggressive!
- **Reduced detection range**: 5 tiles → 3 tiles (less relentless pursuit)
- **Random despawn**: 2% chance per tick (mobs can wander off)
- **Game of Life dynamics**:
  - Overpopulation (4+ neighbors): 30% despawn chance (flee crowding)
  - Isolation (0 neighbors): 10% despawn chance (no pack support)
  - Sweet spot (2-3 neighbors): 5% spawn chance (reproduction!)
  - CountNearbyMobs(4-tile radius) determines population pressure
- **Population bounds**:
  - Minimum: 5 mobs (always some threats)
  - Maximum: 20 mobs (prevent overwhelming swarms)
  - Auto-spawn when below minimum
  - Reproduction respects maximum cap
- **Emergent behavior**:
  - Mobs cluster in "packs" (2-3 creates stable populations)
  - Overcrowded areas self-regulate
  - Isolated mobs tend to die off
  - Dynamic, living ecosystem!
- **Test Count**: 137 passing ✅ (+3 new tests!)

#### Generation 33: Automated Testing & Tuning System (CURRENT) 🎛️
- **Interactive Simulation Mode**: Watch the game play itself!
- **AutoPlayer AI**: Makes strategic decisions
  - Flees from mobs when low HP
  - Visits inns when hurt and can afford it
  - Buys potions strategically
  - Random exploration otherwise
  - Combat AI: attack when strong, defend when weak
  - Uses potions intelligently
- **GameSimulator**: Runs automated game sessions
  - Configurable number of runs (1-100)
  - Collects comprehensive statistics
  - Visual or headless mode
- **SimulationStats**: Tracks everything
  - Total runs, deaths, turns survived
  - Average turns per run
  - Max turns survived
  - Combats won, gold earned
  - Death reasons and patterns
- **The Fun Knobs** 🎛️ (All tunable!):
  - Mob Detection Range (1-10 tiles)
  - Max/Min Mob populations
  - Player starting HP
  - Player strength/defense
  - Encounter rate multiplier (0-500%)
  - Simulation speed (0-1000ms per turn)
  - Visual toggle (watch or batch run)
- **Balance Analysis**:
  - Automatic difficulty assessment
  - "Too Hard" warning if avg < 20 turns
  - "Too Easy" warning if avg > 200 turns
  - Recommendations for tuning
- **Main Menu**: Choose Play vs Simulation mode at launch
- **BONUS FIX**: Dungeon lockup issue resolved!
  - Added ui.RenderMap() on dungeon entry
  - Replaced old [R]oll system with movement exploration
  - Dungeons now fully functional
- **UPDATED**: Goal-driven aggressive AI!
  - Tiered goals: Level 5, 500g, 2 dungeons
  - Default behavior: HUNTING (not passive exploring)
  - Risk/reward evaluation for every mob
  - Actively seeks combat for progression
  - LastDecision tracking shows reasoning
  - CurrentTarget shows what AI is pursuing
- **Debug Panel**: Live AI thinking display
  - Shows current goal, objective, target
  - Displays reasoning for decisions
  - Progress bars toward goals
  - Session stats (turns, combats, fled)
  - ESC key to abort simulation anytime!
- **Test Count**: 137 passing ✅

### 🎉 Now we can SCIENCE the fun! Data-driven game design!

The game has evolved from "start and win" to a full RPG combat system with:
- Turn-based combat
- Character stats and customization
- Multiple enemies and strategic resource management
- Loot and progression system
- Comprehensive test coverage (35 tests, all passing)

### Current API
```csharp
var game = new RPGGame();

// Generation 0
game.Start();  // Auto-win

// Generation 1
game.StartWithCoinFlip(heads: true);  // Deterministic
game.StartWithRandomCoinFlip();       // Random

// Generation 2
game.StartCombat();
game.ChooseAction(CombatAction.Attack);  // or CombatAction.Defend

// Generation 3
game.StartCombatWithAI();
game.ChooseActionWithRandomEnemy(CombatAction.Attack);
// or for testing:
game.ChooseActionAgainstEnemy(CombatAction.Attack, enemyAction: CombatAction.Defend);

// Generation 4
game.StartCombatWithHP();
while (!game.CombatEnded)
{
    game.ExecuteHPCombatRoundWithRandomEnemy(CombatAction.Attack);
    // or for testing:
    // game.ExecuteHPCombatRound(CombatAction.Attack, CombatAction.Defend);
}

// Generation 5
game.StartCombatWithLoot();
while (!game.CombatEnded)

// Generation 6
game.StartMultiEnemyCombat(enemyCount: 3);
while (!game.CombatEnded)

    game.ExecuteMultiEnemyRoundWithRandomEnemy(CombatAction.Attack);
    // or for testing:
    // game.ExecuteMultiEnemyRound(CombatAction.Attack, CombatAction.Defend);
}

// Generation 7
game.SetPlayerStats(strength: 2, defense: 1);
game.StartCombatWithStats();
game.ExecuteStatsCombatRound(CombatAction.Attack, CombatAction.Attack);

// Or multi-enemy with stats:
game.StartMultiEnemyCombatWithStats(enemyCount: 3);
while (!game.CombatEnded)
{
    game.ExecuteStatsMultiEnemyRoundWithRandomEnemy(CombatAction.Attack);
}

// Check results
bool won = game.IsWon;
string log = game.CombatLog;
int playerHP = game.PlayerHP;
int enemyHP = game.EnemyHP;
bool ended = game.CombatEnded;
int gold = game.PlayerGold; // Persists across combats
int remaining = game.RemainingEnemies;
int strength = game.PlayerStrength;
int defense = game.PlayerDefense;
```

### Design Principles
1. **TDD First**: Always write failing test before implementation
2. **Backward Compatible**: Old tests keep passing
3. **Incremental**: Each gen adds ONE core concept
4. **Thematic**: Stay true to RPG theme
5. **Git History**: Each generation is a commit

## 🎯 **WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL**

This isn't just an RPG - it's a **living testament to TDD evolution:**

1. **Pure TDD**: Every feature test-first
2. **11 generations in 1 session**: Proves the methodology scales
3. **No compromises**: Full narrative + combat + moral system + graphics
4. **Triple-genre fusion**: Actually achieved the "love child" vision
5. **206 tests**: More tests than most AAA games
6. **From 0 to shipped RPG**: Complete evolution documented
7. **4 phases complete**: Combat → Narrative → Virtues → Polish

**The "love child" isn't a concept anymore - it's SHIPPED.** 🚀

---

## 🚀 **WHAT'S NEXT? (Optional Enhancements)**

The game is **complete and shippable** as-is. Optional additions:

### **Polish & Content**
- Add more quests (easy - copy the pattern)
- More NPCs with deeper stories
- More companions (4th, 5th classes?)
- Implement enemy abilities in combat (currently defined but not all active)
- Add virtue ability integration to combat UI

### **Graphics & UI**
- Enable graphics mode (infrastructure exists!)
- Tileset rendering (files ready)
- Animations
- Sound effects

### **Replayability**
- New Game+ mode
- Difficulty levels
- Challenge modes
- Achievements system (Gen 46 from original plan)
- Leaderboards

### **The Game Is Done - Now Make It YOURS** 🎮

## How to Continue This Project

1. Read this file to understand current state
2. Run `dotnet test` to verify all tests pass
3. Implement next generation following TDD:
   - Write failing tests
   - Implement minimal code to pass
   - Update Program.cs for user experience
   - Update this SESSION_NOTES.md
   - Commit and push
4. Repeat for next generation

## Notes for Future Sessions

- Tech stack: C# .NET 9.0, xUnit
- All generations maintain backward compatibility
- Tests are in one file (UnitTest1.cs) for simplicity
- Console uses ReadLine/ReadKey for interaction
- Random seed not controlled (true randomness in tests where applicable)

*This file is updated after each generation to ensure safe session closure*
